		<p>I am but a simple man who enjoys the simple pleasures in life. I love to be around soccer. Chelsea FC is my favorite team an the most important thing to me on a weekend is waking up at whatever time to watch them play. I love to coach and play. I love the mountains. The picture on the homepage is the mountain I lived on for awhile during my time as a snowboard instructor at Keystone Mountain in Colorado.</p>
		<p>My goal is to develop my skills as a programmer and developer and create well functioning, easy to follow code for a stable company that allows for individualism and creativity. I eventually want to move back to the mountains, get a couple of husky puppies, and work remotely!</p>
