	<h1>I am John T. Cronin</h1>
	<p>I am a back-end web developer with a degree in Cyber Security from Bellevue University and I am currently a student at Omaha Code School. I continued my education in coding so that I could take my security knowledge and apply it directly into applications. I really enjoy making everything work behind the scenes, including taking a blank text editor and creating a well-functioning secure application, particularly dynamic web apps.   I also enjoy diving into existing programs, breaking them down and rebuilding them to enhance functionality or improve performance.

	<h1>Lets Talk about Me</h1>
	<h2>Who I am</h2>
	<p>Many people use the same words to describe themselves:  passionate, hardworking, driven, and detail oriented. I am those things, which is why I have earned many opportunities in my life. I am more than just those clichés however, I am also loyal, dedicated and go above and beyond to help meet goals.  I am someone who can find the silver lining in things and build team morale.  I am a quick learner with analytical skills that help me to be successful in almost any situation.  New experiences and challenges excite me.</p>
	<p>I have work experience in the customer service industry. I was the interim catering manager and an assistant catering manager for Hy-Vee. I oversaw the entire process for events.  Beginning with initial meetings with brides until the conclusion of the event.  I developed the skills to handle many simultaneous moving pieces, bringing them together successfully.</p>
	<h2>What I love</h2>
	<p>When I am not coding, I am usually coaching soccer. I am a soccer coach of a u11 and a u15  team for a club in Omaha. In the spring, I will start my fourth season as the assistant coach of the Mount Michael Varsity Soccer team.   I was a student athlete, playing soccer all through college, and love teaching the game to young players. 
	</p>
	<p>Another love of mine are the mountains in Colorado.  Last year, as I was finishing my degree from Bellevue, I worked as a snowboard instructor at the Keystone Ski Resort. I was able to follow my passions for the outdoors and snowboarding while maintaining my grades and working full time.

				<h1>Lets Talk about You</h1>
				<h2>Why Mutual of Omaha?</h2>
				<p>Mutual of Omaha is a company that is woven into the fabric of Omaha. Mutual’s involvement in the community as a sponsor is impressive. Along with the sponsorships, I also value the support given to employees as they volunteer in the community.   I have a family history with Mutual because my parents, Ruth and John Cronin, work in the I/S Division.  Mutual of Omaha is a strong, customer focused company that will be around for many years to come.</p>
				<h2>Mutual of Omaha Needs</h2>
				<p>There is a reason that Mutual has been around for so long, they are always trying to evolve and grow. Mutual needs young, smart, talented programmers (much like myself) to continue this growth. There are many well-seasoned employees that have a lot of knowledge and wisdom to share. I am an agile learner, picking things up easily, which would make me a great fit. I am not afraid to try new things and bring in new ideas.  I thrive on constant challenge and like to be given a problem and have leeway on how it is solved. 
				</p>
				<h2>Why me?</h2>
				<p>Not only do I have the technical skills to fit in well, I have the social skills, making me a great addition to Mutual of Omaha.  Playing four years of college soccer, I know what it takes to make a team successful.  I am looking for a company where I can start my IT career and continue to tackle new challenges and opportunities in many years to come.  Mutual of Omaha is a company that not only provides these types of opportunities, but consistently supports its employees’ career development.  I believe that Mutual of Omaha would be a great fit for me, and I would be a great fit for Mutual.
