	<h1>I am John T. Cronin</h1>
	<p>I am a back-end web developer with a degree in Cyber Security from Bellevue University and I am currently a student at Omaha Code School. I continued my education in coding so that I could take my security knowledge and apply it directly into applications. I really enjoy making everything work behind the scenes, including taking a blank text editor and creating a well-functioning secure application, particularly dynamic web apps.   I also enjoy diving into existing programs, breaking them down and rebuilding them to enhance functionality or improve performance.

	<h1>Lets Talk about Me</h1>
	<h2>Who I am</h2>
	<p>Many people use the same words to describe themselves:  passionate, hardworking, driven, and detail oriented. I am those things, which is why I have earned many opportunities in my life. I am more than just those clich√©s however, I am also loyal, dedicated and go above and beyond to help meet goals.  I am someone who can find the silver lining in things and build team morale.  I am a quick learner with analytical skills that help me to be successful in almost any situation.  New experiences and challenges excite me.</p>
	<p>I have work experience in the customer service industry. I was the interim catering manager and an assistant catering manager for Hy-Vee. I oversaw the entire process for events.  Beginning with initial meetings with brides until the conclusion of the event.  I developed the skills to handle many simultaneous moving pieces, bringing them together successfully.</p>
	<h2>What I love</h2>
	<p>When I am not coding, I am usually coaching soccer. I am a soccer coach of a u11 and a u15  team for a club in Omaha. In the spring, I will start my fourth season as the assistant coach of the Mount Michael Varsity Soccer team.   I was a student athlete, playing soccer all through college, and love teaching the game to young players. 
	</p>
	<p>Another love of mine are the mountains in Colorado.  Last year, as I was finishing my degree from Bellevue, I worked as a snowboard instructor at the Keystone Ski Resort. I was able to follow my passions for the outdoors and snowboarding while maintaining my grades and working full time.

				<h1>Lets Talk about You</h1>
				<h2>NTT Security Needs</h2>
				<p>The cyber security field is always growing and changing. As you know, there are more ways to hack systems than there are ways to protect them. By working with customers, part of that process is to understand their needs. Through my customer service skills, I gained while working at Hy-Vee, through my schooling at Bellevue, receiving a cyber security degree, and now at Omaha Code School, I can understand every single part of the equation. This would make me a great fit at NTT Security. I have all of the skills necessary to make me successful.
				</p>
				<h2>Why me?</h2>
				<p>Not only do I have the technical skills to fit in well, but I have the social skills to really make a team work. Playing college soccer for four years, I know what it takes to be a part of the team as well as make the team better. This paired with my technical skills can make me a great addition to any team at NTT Security.
				</p>
				<h2>My Hopes For Us</h2>
				<p> I am looking for a company that will allow me to grow. I want constant challenges and ways to improve. I believe with its vast reach of technology solutions, NTT can give me that opportunity to grow. I will always be pushing for growth and better solutions. NTT is a company that would allow and encourage that. I believe that NTT would be a great fit for me, and that I would be a great fit for you.
