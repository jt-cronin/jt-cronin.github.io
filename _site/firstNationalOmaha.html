	<h1>I am John T. Cronin</h1>
	<p>I am a back-end web developer with a degree in Cyber Security from Bellevue University and I am currently a student at Omaha Code School. I continued my education in coding so that I could take my security knowledge and apply it directly into applications. I really enjoy making everything work behind the scenes, including taking a blank text editor and creating a well-functioning secure application, particularly dynamic web apps.   I also enjoy diving into existing programs, breaking them down and rebuilding them to enhance functionality or improve performance.

	<h1>Lets Talk about Me</h1>
	<h2>Who I am</h2>
	<p>Many people use the same words to describe themselves:  passionate, hardworking, driven, and detail oriented. I am those things, which is why I have earned many opportunities in my life. I am more than just those clichés however, I am also loyal, dedicated and go above and beyond to help meet goals.  I am someone who can find the silver lining in things and build team morale.  I am a quick learner with analytical skills that help me to be successful in almost any situation.  New experiences and challenges excite me.</p>
	<p>I have work experience in the customer service industry. I was the interim catering manager and an assistant catering manager for Hy-Vee. I oversaw the entire process for events.  Beginning with initial meetings with brides until the conclusion of the event.  I developed the skills to handle many simultaneous moving pieces, bringing them together successfully.</p>
	<h2>What I love</h2>
	<p>When I am not coding, I am usually coaching soccer. I am a soccer coach of a u11 and a u15  team for a club in Omaha. In the spring, I will start my fourth season as the assistant coach of the Mount Michael Varsity Soccer team.   I was a student athlete, playing soccer all through college, and love teaching the game to young players. 
	</p>
	<p>Another love of mine are the mountains in Colorado.  Last year, as I was finishing my degree from Bellevue, I worked as a snowboard instructor at the Keystone Ski Resort. I was able to follow my passions for the outdoors and snowboarding while maintaining my grades and working full time.

				<h1>Lets Talk about You</h1>
				<h2>First National Needs</h2>
				<p>First National is a company that is woven into the fabric of Omaha. Their involvement in the community as sponsors is impressive. Not only sponsorships, but employees constantly volunteer in the community. The company is well focused on supporting the growth of Omaha, which I admire. My good friend, Alex Prusa, works at First National and has nothing but good things to say. A problem from being such a well-established company is that there are a lot of technological needs that must be updated. Web based services may appear outdated, while staying functional. A young web developer like myself would be a great fit for this problem. First National is a strong company that will be around for many years to come, I want to be a part of that.
				</p>
				<h2>Why me?</h2>
				<p>There is a reason that First National has been around for so long, they are always trying to evolve and grow. First National needs young, smart, talented programmers (much like myself) to continue this growth. There are many well-seasoned employees already there that have a lot of knowledge and wisdom to give. I am an agile learner that can pick things up quickly, which would make me a great fit. I am not afraid to try new things or push the way others think, even if they are older or more experienced. I would continue to challenge those around me, as well as accept the challenges given to me.
				</p>
				<h2>My Hopes For Us</h2>
				<p> Not only do I have the technical skills to fit in well, but I have the social skills to really make a team work. Playing college soccer for four years, I know what it takes to be a part of the team as well as make the team better. This paired with my technical skills can make me a great addition to any team at First National.
				</p>
				<p>I am looking for a company that will allow me to grow. I want constant challenges and ways to improve. I believe with its vast reach; First National can give me those opportunities to grow. I will always be pushing for growth and better solutions. First National is a company that would allow and encourage that, which is necessary for me as a person and as a professional. I believe that First National would be a great fit for me, and that I would be a great fit for you.
