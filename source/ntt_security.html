				<h1>I am John T. Cronin</h1>
				<p>I am back-end web developer with a degree in Cyber Security from Bellevue University. I have fallen in love with making everything work behind the scenes. Being able to create a well functioning program out of a blank text editor is what gets me excited. I also love diving through already written codes and experimenting by breaking them down and rebuilding to find the little things that make the program tick and work.

				<h1>Lets Talk about Me</h1>
				<h2>Who I am</h2>
				<p>People will always use the same words to describe themselves, passionate, hardworking, driven, and detail oriented. I am those things, which is why I have been given the opportunities that I have in my life. I am more than just those cliches. I am loyal. If I believe in someone or an organization, I would follow them until the end. I am someone who can find the silver linings in things and build team morale around them. If there is something I am passionate about, there is nothing that can stop me. I am an agile learner with analysis skills that lead me to be successful no matter the situation I am placed into. New experiences and challenges excite me, instead of scaring me. 
				<p>I have work experience in the customer service industry. I was the interim catering mangaer and then the assistant catering manager after for Hy-Vee. I would see the entire process for catering events through. From initial meetings with brides until the actual event with everything inbetween. I developed the skills to handle many moving pieces at the same time and bring them together.</p>
				</p>
				<h2>What I love</h2>
				<p>
				When I am not coding, I am usually coaching soccer. I am a coach on u11 and u15 boys soccer teams here for a club in Omaha. In the spring, I will be the assistant coach for the Mount Michael Varisty Soccer team. I played soccer all through college and I love being able to teach the game to young players. 
				</p>
				<p>Another love of mine are the mountains in Colorado. Last year, as I was finishing my degree from Bellevue, I worked as a snowboard instructor at Keystone Resort. I was able to follow my passions of the outdoors and snowboarding while maintaining my grades and working full time.

				<h1>Lets Talk about You</h1>
				<h2>NTT Security Needs</h2>
				<p>The cyber security field is always growing and changing. As you know, there are more ways to hack systems than there are ways to protect them. By working with customers, part of that process is to understand their needs. Through my customer service skills I gained while working at Hy-Vee, through my schooling at Bellevue, recieving a cyber security degree, and now at Omaha Code School, I can understand every single part of the equation. This would make me a great fit at NTT Security. I have all of the skills necessary to make me successful.
				</p>
				<h2>Why me?</h2>
				<p>Not only do I have the technical skills to fit in well, but I have the social skills to really make a team work. Playing college soccer for four years, I know what it takes to be a part of the team as well as make the team better. This paired with my technical skills can make me a great addition to any team at NTT Security.
				</p>
				<h2>My Hopes For Us</h2>
				<p> I am looking for a company that will allow me to grow. I want constant challenges and ways to improve. I believe with its vast reach of technology solutions, NTT can give me that opportunity to grow. I will always be pushing for growth and better solutions. NTT is a company that would allow and encourage that. I believe that NTT would be a great fit for me, and that I would be a great fit for you.
